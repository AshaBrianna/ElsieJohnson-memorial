					Elsie Pauline Norman Johnson, 90, passed away on Friday, September 4, 2020 at her home in Oakland,
					CA.
				</p>
				<p>
					Elsie was born to the late Paul and Corine Norman, on April 8, 1930 in Kossuth, MS. Daughter of a
					sharecropper
					father and seamstress mother, Elsie grew up in the church, attending Mt. Pleasant Missionary
					Baptist, Macedonia
					Missionary Baptist, and Alcorn Baptist churches.
				</p>
				<p>
					Elsie graduated Corinth Colored High School with a 4.2 GPA, then attended Tougaloo College, earning
					a B.S. in
					Biology. An active Tougaloo student, Elsie was a member of the Paul Robeson Theatrical Society,
					crossed into the
					first Mississippi chapter of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority in 1950, was crowned “Ms. Tougaloo” the same
					year, and was
					voted “Most Popular” her senior year. While at Tougaloo, Elsie also met future husband, Ardee
					Johnson, a member of
					the Football team and Omega Psi Phi Fraternity. She married the McComb, MS native on September 7,
					1950 in Pike
					County, MS. Elsie graduated from Tougaloo on May 29, 1951.
				</p>
				<p>
					After graduation, Elsie followed her husband to Washington, DC where they started a family. While
					supporting her
					husband through dental school at Howard University, Elsie worked for the NAACP. The family continued
					to grow as
					Elsie joined Air Force Captain Johnson on bases across America, and for a post-war tour in Japan,
					before ultimately
					settling in Oakland, CA, where her husband began a long, successful dental career.
				</p>
				<p>
					For the next 65 years, Elsie continued a lifelong dedication to family, the Oakland community, and
					public service.
					She is remembered by many in the greater Bay Area for her years of work in the Oakland Public
					Schools system, and as
					an administrative assistant for California’s State Board of Equalization, the Department of Public
					Health, the
					Center for Infectious Diseases, and the Employment Development Department.
				</p>
				<p>
					Elsie remained active in the African-American community through work with Delta Sigma Theta Inc.,
					the Links Inc.,
					and as a long-standing member of Allen Temple Baptist Church. In her spare time, she enjoyed
					bowling, music (choral
					singing, gospel, Jazz and R&B), and was an avid dancer.
				</p>
				<p>
					Elsie is preceded in death by her brothers, Joseph L., and Edward L. She is survived by her 4
					children. Also joined in fond
					memories of
					Elsie are 9 grandchildren, 3 nieces, 1 nephew, and numerous friends.
				</p>
				<p>
					Plans for a memorial have been temporarily postponed due to the pandemic.
