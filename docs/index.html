					Elsie Pauline Norman Johnson, 90, passed away on Friday, September 4, 2020 at her home in Oakland, CA.
				</p>
				<p>
					Elsie was born to the late Paul and Corine Norman on April 8, 1930 in Kossuth, MS. Daughter of a sharecropper and seamstress, Elsie grew up in the church, attending Mt. Pleasant Missionary Baptist, Macedonia Missionary Baptist, and Alcorn Baptist churches.
				</p>
				<p>
					Elsie graduated Corinth Colored High School with a 4.2 GPA. She then attended Tougaloo College, earning a B.S. in Biology. An active student, Elsie was a member of the Paul Robeson Theatrical Society and crossed into the first Mississippi chapter of the Delta Sigma Theta Sorority in 1950. She was crowned “Ms. Tougaloo” the same year, and was voted “Most Popular”. While at Tougaloo, Elsie met Ardee Johnson, a member of the Football team and Omega Psi Phi Fraternity. She married the McComb, MS native on September 7, 1950 in Pike County, MS. Elsie graduated from Tougaloo on May 29, 1951.
				</p>
				<p>
					After graduation, Elsie followed her husband to Washington, DC where they started a family. While
					supporting her husband through dental school at Howard University, Elsie worked for the NAACP. The family continued	to grow as Elsie joined Air Force Captain Johnson on bases across America, and for a post-war tour in Japan. They ultimately settled in Oakland, CA, where her husband began a long, successful dental career.
				</p>
				<p>
					For the next 65 years, Elsie continued a lifelong dedication to family, the Oakland community, and public service. She is remembered by many for her years of work in the Oakland Public Schools system and as an administrative assistant for California’s State Board of Equalization, the Department of Public Health, the Center for Infectious Diseases, and the Employment Development Department.
				</p>
				<p>
					Elsie remained active in the African-American community through work with Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, the Links, and Allen Temple Baptist Church. In her spare time, she enjoyed bowling, music (choral singing, gospel, Jazz and R&amp;B), and was an avid dancer.
				</p>
				<p>
					Elsie is preceded in death by her brothers, Joseph L., and Edward L. She is survived by her four children, Cheryl, Andrea, Ardee, &amp; Christopher. Also joined in fond memories of Elsie are 9 grandchildren, 7 nieces, 1 nephew, and numerous friends.

						She always prided herself on her independance and relished in her autonomy. She was such a strong, confident, fearless woman, never afraid to boldly speak her mind... definitely a woman born long before her time.

						Walks to the grocery store, people-watching from the balcony, riding BART, movies at the Grand Lake theater, the way you made my oatmeal extra creamy (I still make it this way), cookies from the cookie jar, drinking Martinelli's apple juice out of those original glass bottles (my favorite!), taking baths in your tub with your shower pillow, your famous salmon cakes for dinner (I loved those!), gospel playing on the record player while you sang...I could go on. Some of the best sleepovers I've ever had. Forever memories with you, Grandmommy

					<blockquote>
						Family was so important to Goddy. She'd always be so excited to talk on the phone. Her birthday calls made my day everytime, and she never missed a single one. She always wanted people to know she cared about them, and she loved to keep reminders that people loved and cared about her. Whenever I gifted her things like soaps and scarves, she'd open them, then meticulously rewrap everything in the original giftwrap, stating, "Of course I'm not gonna use these, you gave them to me". Before I could take it personally, she'd elaborate, explaining she found gifts too precious to use and would rather keep the reminders that people loved and cared about her. The only gifts guaranteed to be put to use were sweets. Cookies, brownies, pralines, chocolate turtles, those would all be gone in a day... easily :)

					<blockquote>
							Elsie was the first neighbor I met when I moved into the building. I would visit her a couple times a week during the pandemic. During our visits, I would sit in the hall with my tea and she would tell me stories about her life, share thoughts on politics, give me tips on relaxation, and catch me up on all the latest Oakland and California news. I miss our visits and hearing her laugh. I miss her concern and advice. I am incredibly grateful to have had the opportunity to know her.

							Memories of Aunt Elsie are of an energetic and vibrant woman who loved family gatherings and loved each family member.

					<blockquote>
							I went to school with Elsie's youngest, Christopher, from 7th through 12th grades. Many times he and I waited together for our rides and talked at the top of the steep driveway. Elsie often gave me a ride home, sometimes even allowing me to stuff my bike in the trunk. I saw her at school on numerous occasions over the years, so I got a sense of her unique, exquisite personhood. I always looked forward to my interactions with her. If I had to summarize the qualities I saw most in her, I'd have to say she was: A. Strong; and B. Funny. She was strong in the sense that you could tell she could not easily be messed with. You could just tell . . . if she was on your side, you considered yourself very lucky. She also loved to poke fun at whatever opportunity might present itself. She laughed and smiled a LOT - almost constantly, and she did so with an intensity and a benevolence that is rare and wonderful, when it can be found. I'm honored to have known her.
							<br>
							I am very happy to see that Elsie's memory, indeed her life, has been BEAUTIFULLY preserved and honored. I am very grateful to have been offered a glimpse into her timeline, the important milestones of her life. It's far more clear to me now than in all the years I bumped into her so casually at school, she truly was a remarkable person from the very start. We are all blessed to have had her in our lives. Her life, and the intensity and love she brought with her wherever she went, is an inspiration.
